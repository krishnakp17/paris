                <h3>About Paris</h3>

                <p>
                    Paris lives up to its hype: A city with unbelievable food and culture, plus stunning views
                    everywhere you turn. With 18 arrondissements, it’s a lot to see in one trip, but each neighbourhood
                    has a personality all its own. You can’t miss the iconic 7th, where art and history meet—there’s the
                    Eiffel Tower, sure, but the impressive Musée du quai Branly is just a short walk away. It houses an
                    amazing collection of indigenous art. Or, hit up Montmartre (the 18th), with its boho shops and cosy
                    brasseries. It’s a must-stop on the way up or down from Sacre Coeur. While the French practically
                    invented fine dining, don’t skip the street food—Paris has world-class kebabs and falafel. But no
                    matter where you are, be sure to pop into a sidewalk cafe, sip a glass of wine, and people
                    watch—it’s the way to get a taste of true Parisian culture.Paris is especially known for its museums
                    and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 8.9. million visitors in 2023, on track for keeping
                    its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.Paris is one of the few world capitals that
                    has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. For this, even its earliest history is still
                    visible in its streetmap.

                    “Yes, you'll find the Mona Lisa, Winged Victory, Venus de Milo, and the crowds [at the Louvre],
                    but…the secret to this museum is that the hoards are usually only interested in the main
                    attractions. For example, if you visit the floor dedicated to the early masters (Rembrandt, Van
                    Dyck, etc.) you'll have the place to yourself.”<br>
